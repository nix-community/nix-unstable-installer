# Nix unstable installer

This project is about making Nix unstable release available to the general
public. It allows to test and use preview features like Flakes and provide
early feedback.

All it does is copy the release tarballs from Hydra and tweak the install
script so that it fetches them from GitHub instead.

## Latest release

* Release: `nix-2.8.0pre20220325_1844172`
* Hydra eval: <https://hydra.nixos.org/eval/1751105>

## Usage

### Systems

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://github.com/numtide/nix-unstable-installer/releases/download/nix-2.8.0pre20220325_1844172/install)

    # Run the general flake checks
    - run: nix flake check
    # Verify that the main program builds
    - run: nix shell -c echo OK
```
