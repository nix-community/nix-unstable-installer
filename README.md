# Nix Unstable Installer

This project is about making Nix unstable releases available to the general
public. It allows to test and use preview features like Flakes and provide
early feedback.

All it does is copy the release tarballs from Hydra and tweak the install
script so that it fetches them from GitHub instead.

## Usage
